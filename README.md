# myforest/heatpump-act

A set of scripts to determine what actions we should request the heatpump to perform.

This is based on tooling [David Bowen](https://github.com/MyForest) built from 2019-09-30 which has been used to control an Ecodan 14kW.

A lot of discussion relating to this can be found on the [OpenEnergyMonitor Community](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/search?q=%40myforest%20%23heatpump).
